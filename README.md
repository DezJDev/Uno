# Uno
This is my first personal project. After I've completed the first step Docstring's formation, I decide to implement a Uno with Python to practice what I've learned.
In this readme i will explain you how it works, where are my difficulties and how can I improve this project in the futur.
So let's start our journey with how I've created a card.

### Card.py
|Uno is a card game. To begin, I needed to create all cards in the game.

|At a moment we wanted to know when a card is a joker. So we will is isJoker() a boolean methods that returns true or false if the card is a joker or no.
|That's all for card.py

Now we
